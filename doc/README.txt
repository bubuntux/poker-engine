Texas Hold'em poker
===================


Introduction
------------

This project has been created as a platform to experiment with a Texas Hold'em poker game in Java.

Its primary goal is to offer a clean, open source Texas Hold'em poker engine in Java. The game
engine strives to follow the famous Robert's Rules of Poker as close as possible. In order to test
the game engine, the project also offers a Swing GUI and bots.

GUI, with the human player playing against 3 bots.

Disclaimer

This project is created only because of my love for Java and my interest in the game of poker. As a
Christian, I strongly oppose to any form of gambling, as I believe it eventually leads to a path of
greed, destruction and suffering.
